The Road Behind
We travelled a great distance in this chapter

We added the Angular Router to navigate among different components.
We learned how to create router links to represent navigation menu items.
We used router link parameters to navigate to the details of user selected hero.
We shared the HeroService among multiple components.
We moved HTML and CSS out of the component file and into their own files.
We added the uppercase pipe to format data.
We refactored routes into a Routing Module that we import.
The Road Ahead
We have much of the foundation we need to build an application. We're still missing a key piece: remote data access.

In the next chapter, weâ€™ll replace our mock data with data retrieved from a server using http.

Start at HTTP get and save data.
